        Java is the one of the most  
        popular programming language  
        for many years. Java is also known as Object  
        Oriented Programming Language. But we cannot say that Java is not  
        considered as pure object-oriented  
        as it provides support for primitive  
        data types (like int, char, etc) The  
        Java codes are first compiled into byte  
        code (machine-independent code). Then  
        the byte code is run on Java Virtual  
        Machine (JVM), regardless of the  
        underlying architecture.
